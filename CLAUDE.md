# AI Tutor MCP Server - Claude Reference Guide

This MCP server provides Claude with intelligent access to student educational data, enabling personalized tutoring experiences. The server separates **teaching content** (lessons) from **student work** (assignments/quizzes) for optimal AI tutoring support.

## Overview

The server offers two focused tools that distinguish between what students are learning (lessons) and what they need help with (their assignments, worksheets, quizzes, and tests).

## Available Tools

}
```

### 2. `search_student_work`

}
```

### 3. `get_material_details`
**Purpose**: Get complete content for a specific educational material, including all questions and answers
**Best for**: Deep dive into specific assignments or lessons when AI needs full context for tutoring

**Parameters**:

## Tutoring Flow Recommendations

### 1. Identify Student Need
When a student asks for help:
- Use `search_student_work` to find what they need to work on
- Look for overdue items, upcoming due dates, or specific assignments they mention
- Note the preview questions shown in search results

### 2. Get Full Assignment Details  
Once you identify the specific assignment:
- Use `get_material_details` with the assignment title/ID
- This gives you ALL questions, answer key, and learning objectives
- Shows related lesson content for teaching context

### 3. Get Additional Teaching Context (if needed)
If you need more background on the topic:
- Use `search_lessons` with relevant keywords from the assignment
- Use `get_material_details` on the parent lesson for full teaching notes

### 4. Provide Targeted Help
With complete material details:
- Reference specific questions the student is working on
- Use learning objectives to frame explanations
- Connect lesson context to assignment questions
- Provide step-by-step guidance based on teaching methodology

### 5. Track Progress
Use filters in `search_student_work`:
- `low_scores: true` to identify areas needing more practice  
- `status: "completed"` to review what they've mastered
- `status: "due_soon"` to prioritize urgent work

## Visual Indicators

The server provides helpful visual cues:
- **Urgency Indicators**: üö® OVERDUE, ‚ö†Ô∏è DUE TODAY, ‚è∞ DUE TOMORROW

## Best Practices for AI Tutoring

1. **Two-Step Approach**: When helping with assignments, first search lessons for teaching context, then search student work for the specific assignment
2. **Use Lesson Context**: Always reference learning objectives and key topics from lessons when explaining concepts
3. **Prioritize by Urgency**: Use status filters to identify overdue or due-soon items first
4. **Track Performance**: Use `low_scores: true` to identify concepts that need reinforcement
5. **Subject-Specific Help**: Filter by subject to focus on specific academic areas
